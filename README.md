# FrameWarden
A network rendering frame dispatcher created by Nathan Warden for use with [Luxology's Modo][lux] 3D rendering and animation software.

This software was on sale for a relatively short time until it went dark for a little while. Nathan (the original author and owner of this app) recently decided to give out the source (RealBasic) but he is not able to continue supporting the project. So here it isâ€¦

From the [original announcement][luxforum] (August 31st, 2012):

> Hey Everybody,

> I have had several requests lately from people who tell me Frame Warden still works with Modo 601 and that they were wondering if they can have the source to it. Well, here it is! It comes without any warranty and a "Use at your own risk".

> Some things you may need to know:
> 
> 1. In the Admin\Licenses folder there's a LicenseGen program so you can generate yourself a license
> 
> 2. There are tutorial videos in the Tutorials folder
> 
> 3. It comes with little and probably no support from me. I'm just way too busy with other projects and don't even use the rendering side of Modo very much anymore since I'm a Game Developer and not really doing prerendered CG like I used to when I developed it.

> 4. It was written in REALBasic (and if I had to do it all over again would have written it in C#)

> Anyway, I hope this will be very beneficial to the Modo community,

## Source
Most of the original source is a [RealBasic][rbp] project file and the original `.zip` package released by Nathan is on [Google Docs][gdrive] as well as uncompressed and cleaned up in this repo under the branch `original`.  
The tutorial videos in the have been re-compressed with [MPEG Streamclip][mpeg] as MP4 200kbps h.264 to avoid filling up the repo with 200+mb of video materials.
